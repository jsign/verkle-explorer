# verkle-explorer

This is a (very^2) simple frontend for the Witness explorer. 

I'm not (nor want to become) a web UI developer, so looking for good a enough solution. :)

## How to use it?

Use it as a library and you're good to go. All the HTML assets will be automatically embeded in your binary, thus you don't need to deploy these assets separately.

Thanks to [Start Boostrap Sb Admin 2](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2) (open source, MIT) template which is the one I used to build this project.
